<h2>Hachiko </h2>
<h3> This Akita Inu dog lived near the city of Odete, Japan. His story proves how caring and devoted dogs can be.
His owner Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor at Tokyo University, was returning home each day by train.

And each day, at the same time, Hachiko would wait for his owner (and best friend) at the train station, to greet him and accompany him home. He did this for years, until one day in May 1925, when Hachikoâ€™s owner failed to show up. Unfortunately, he suffered a fatal hemorrhage.

But Hachiko kept returning to Shibuya Station for nine years thereafter, still waiting for his master to return at the exact time the train arrives.

In 1935, the devoted Akita Inu was found dead in the streets of Shibuya.</h3>
